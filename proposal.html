			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h3>The Topic</h3>
			<p>The foundation of the website proposal will be based upon the not-for-profit Charity "Australian Red Cross Lifeblood".
				The ARCL plays an important role in the healthcare system by ensuring that patients in Australian hospitals receive life-saving
				blood products, delivering world-class research and provide expertise in diagnostic, transplantation and other clinical
				services, so helping reduce suffering (ACNC, n.d). Particularly, the intended call-to-action of the Australian Red Cross
				Lifeblood is to encourage eligible users to donate blood in order to achieve their ultimate goal of saving lives.<br><br> The Australian Red Cross Blood Service collects around 1.3 million blood donations anually of which is used to help people with medical conditions that require blood for suitable treatment. For instance, 34% of donated red blood cells are used to help treat people with cancer and blood diseases such as haemophilia (Better Health, n.d). Correspondingly, medical researchers use donated blood in order to develop and test new treatments for various medical conditions such as blod clots, heart attack, stroke and cancer.</p>
      <h3>The Implications of the Current Website and Process</h3>
      <p> While an existing website exists to facillitate this process of blood donation, the user experience and process is deeply flawed in its ability to effectively guide the user to achieve its intended call-to-action of donating blood. This is particularly shown through two major failiures of the website including: 
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>A clustered and ambigious user interface and experience:</strong> The current information architecture is scattered among the website; making it excessively difficult for the user to navigate their way through an intended easy process of donating blood. Correspondingly, the oversaturation of visual CSS elements on various pages of the website make it overwhelming for the user to navigate their way through the already ambigious information architecture.</li>
          <li> <strong>The disposal and refusal of un-eligible users who cannot donate blood:</strong> The inherent flaw behind the sheer concept of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood is that it neglects users who are not eligible for blood. Users who have already taken a considerable amount of time to make their way through a convoluted process of attempting to donate blood should not be abruptly turned away from the process but rather provided with an alternative means to support the intent of the cause. For instance, raising awareness and promoting the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood through social media.</li>
        </ul>
      Hence, the intended website design proposal will capatalise on these fundamental flaws that the current website presents. This will be achieved by creating and designing a website with an effective user experience and interface that will  facillitate and guide both eligible and non-eligible users to navigate through an effective process to achieve the intended goals of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. </p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <p>Both primary and secondary research was conducted in order to provide context of the function and concept of the intended web design proposal.
      <h4>Primary Research</h4>
      <p>Primary research had been conducted through the form of informal interviews. Through this, three interviewees from various backgrounds were asked on their <strong>opinions on the current Australian Red Cross Lifeblood website</strong> and had used methods such as the <em>think-aloud protocol</em> to justify their thought processess while exploring the website. Correspondingly, interviewees were asked <strong>contextual information regarding to how they commit to various charities as well as their experiences with blood donation.</strong> Thus, it was through this primary research in the form of informal interviews that had expanded the designers understanding and empathy regarding the interaction between people and charities; particularly blood donation.<br><br> Here are some <strong>key quotes</strong> regarding the interviewees opinons in the current Red Cross Lifeblood website as brought about by the think-aloud protocol.</p>
      <blockquote>"The website is kind of clustered and overwhelming to use. I honestly don't know where to go first since everything is just popping out at me" <strong>Jessica Tan, 39</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I really like the colour scheme of the website; specifically the red colour that represents blood of which is what this website is all about. However, this website needs a bit of a cleanup because there are too many buttons and options to click on" <strong>Nathan Trung, 36</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I was actually going to consider giving blood, so I spent all my time during this long and tedious process just to be told I was not eligible. I don't know why I had bothered to put so much effort in the first place" <strong>Emily Smith, 17</strong></blockquote>
      <p>Moreover, here are some additional <strong>key quotes</strong> regarding the interviewees experience with charities in general as well as blood donation:</p>
      <blockquote>"I have been donating blood for nearly 6 years now. It is an effective way for me to support others in need while I don't have to spend too much" <strong>Jessica Tan, 39</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I always donate clothes to St Vincent De Paul society, however I have slightly considered blood donation but never really encourage myself to go enough. To be very honest, I don't even know if I am eligible or not" <strong>Nathan Trung, 36</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"In terms of charity work, I have participated in many charities and fundraisers at school, however I have never donated blood because I don't think I can until I turn 18. If there was any other possible way I could support the cause, I definitely would" <strong>Emily Smith, 17</strong></blockquote>
      <h4>Secondary Research</h4>
			<p>Secondary research had been conducted in order to find various statistics on how blood donations play a vital role in saving lives of which the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood facillitates. These statistics would serve to play a vital role in emphasising the sheer impact and influence that blood donation has on society. Hence, these include: <ul>
        <li> One in three Australians will need blood or blood products in their lifetime (ARCL, 2019)</li>
        <li> One in 30 Australians give blood each year (3%) (ARCL, 2019) </li>
        <li> One blood donation can save up to three lives (ARCL, 2019) </li>
        <li> Australia needs more than 31,000 donations every week (ARCL, 2019) </li>
        </ul>
      Correspondingly, donor statistics between 2018 - 2019 included:
      <ul>
        <li> 523,688 Australians voluntarily gave blood, plasma or platelets to help others (ACRL, 2019) </li>
        <li> 978,196 blood products delivered to hospitals and healthcare providers to help Australian patients (ACRL, 2019) </li>
      </ul>
      Therefore, the intended web proposal will effectively serve to provide an effective user experience and interface in order to successfully facillitate the donation of blood. Correspondingly, the design proposal will also <strong>introduce two new call-to-actions</strong> in order to accommodate for those users who are ineligible and unable to donate blood. Hence, this includes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Allowing the user to <em>raise awareness</em> through social media:</strong> For instance, clicking on a pre-filled facebook post that users can post to their social media wall for their friends and family to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Allowing the user to <em>donate money</em>:</strong> For instance, the user can choose to donate a specified amount of money to the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. These donations can go towards costs such as advertising, wages and various expenses of the business.</p>

			</figure>
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Through both primary and secondary research, two distinct user profiles had been compiled. As all user populations contain a degree of variation, user profiles present key attributes of different identified users in an overview table that can show the full spectrum of possible users (Tomitsch, 2019). Hence, the following user profiles present the two distinct target markets; including their demographics, needs, requirements, motivations, frustrations and obstables to interact:</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/TILESUP.jpg" alt="User Profile 1"/>
        <figcaption>User profile for the <strong>Eligible Blood Donator</strong></figcaption>

				<img src="images/TILESUP2.jpg" alt="User Profile 2"/>
        <figcaption>User profile for the <strong>Inligible Blood Donator</strong></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is notable that there are a wide variety of users who are <strong>unaware</strong> of whether they are eligible or not for blood donation. Hence, the intended website proposal will provide a means for unaware users to find out whether they are able to donate blood. Through the outcome, those users will either fall into the <strong>eligible blood donator</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>ineligible blood donator</strong> user profile.

		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The ideation phase of the intended web design proposal will effectively lay out the early stage design work in the process of creating the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood website. Particularly, the ideation phase was conducted through both moodboards and sketches. Hence, it was through both moodboards and sketches (and its numerous iterations) that had laid the foundation for the 'design' phase of the website proposal. </p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Mood boards are used to visually represent design ideas, concepts and values in an open-ended and evocative way (Tomitsch, 2019). It is through the power of mood boards that show ideas in evocative and suggestive ways to encourage discussion and idea generation (Tomistch, 2019). Hence, a digital moodboard was created on an A3 page to show various aspects that the intended website proposal will take reference from; thus outlining the intended look and feel of the website. Hence, the following moodboard was created in order to serve as a direct indicator for what the intended website proposal will look like; particularly through <em>colour palettes, typography, iconography, UI elements, infographics, other website examples</em> and so on. These aspects contained within the moodboard had also been justified and rationalised through short annotations.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/MOODBOARD.jpg" alt="Moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Moodboard with various aspects to be incorporated within the website design proposal</figcaption>
      </figure>
        <br>
      <h3 id="Sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
      <p>A sitemap had been created to detail the page hierachy of the intended website design proposal as well as topic categorisation. The following sitemap explicitly shows the main and simple 'path' of the website for users to donate blood. Correspondingly, it gives both eligible and ineligible users a personalised option to support the 'cause' of the charity through which they are best suited for. Moreover, the sitemap also explores the 'side-details' of the website, including finding a centre, terms and conditions, privacy policy, and contact methods. Thus, the sitemap effectively shows how the intended website design proposal will expand the call-to-action of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood by giving ineligible users an alternative means to show their support.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/Sitemap.jpg" alt="Sitemap"/>
        <figcaption>The sitemap for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood</figcaption>
        <br>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Sketches are tools used by designers to visually represent and depict physical aspects while composing an idea for a product or service (Tomitsch, 2019). As sketches are 'excellent tools to communicate ideas to stakeholders and colleagues' as well as 'facillitate discussion, understanding and critique' (Tomitsch, 2019) they had been effectively used and embedded within the ideation phase of the intended website design proposal. Both the previous moodboard and sitemap were used interdependently in order to guide the foundation of which the sketches were created upon. Particularly the visual aides and styles brought about the moodboard and the effective website structure of the sitemap were used to effectively create these sketches, both in desktop and smartphone format. Hence, the intended Australian Red Cross Lifeblood website form, layout and structure had been sketched with pencil and paper. Correspondingly, they had been annotated with various design descisions, justifications and rationales.</p>
      <h4>The Major UI Difference Between Desktop and Smartphone</h4>
      <p> While conducting the sketching phase of the intended design proposal, it had become clear that the designers had to establish a rigid structure for which the user interface could be laid out on both desktop and smartphone. It was also extremely significant to ensure that there were no major UI differences between these two platforms to ensure a balanced and similar approach to the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood website; regardless form which platform the user is accessing the website from. Hence, the following image shows a sketch that explicitly shows the major UI difference between desktop and smartphone platforms; particularly through <strong>navigation.</strong></p>

          <li><strong>The desktop platform</strong> shows the navigation bar at the top of the website, clearly laid out.</li>
          <li><strong>The smartphone platform</strong> shows the navigation bar in the form of a UI 'hamburger button' of which when clicked, prompts a sliding transition that shows all the same navigation elements that the dekstop does.</li>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The design phase of the intended web design proposal will explicitly show the gradual transformation of the website from low to high fidelity. This is particularly shown through <strong>wireframes</strong> of which are low fidelity - to <strong>mockups</strong> of which are high fidelity. Correspondingly, the intended website design proposal had been concluded with a <strong>user flow diagram</strong> of which had depicted the possible paths and navigation the users could take throughout the website; using the mockups as an indicator to explicitly show these pathways. </p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Wireframes are line drawings that show the fundamental structure of functions (Tomistch, 2019) of a website. In essence, the use of wireframes have given the designers the ability to effectively provide detail regarding layout, structure, content and form of the intended website design proposal. <br><br>Using the previous sketches as an indicator, a wireframe was created for each page of the intended website design proposal in Adobe Illustrator; particularly for both the desktop and smartphone platform. Correspondingly, the wireframes had been annotated with various design descisions, justifications and rationales throughout the creation process. Hence, the wireframes include: </p>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>Mockups visualise the detailed representation of an envisioned product early on in a design process (Tomitsch, 2020). They are used for creating high-fidelity representation of the visual design, including style, colour, content, font and so on. Hence, using the wireframes as a reference and foundation, a mockup had been created for each page of the intended website design proposal for both the desktop and smartphone platform. Correspondingly, the mockups had been annotated with various design descisions, justifications and rationales throughout the creation process. Hence, the mockups include: </p>

      <h3 id="userflowdiagram">User Flow Diagram</h3>
      <p>In order to show the interaction aspect of the mockup, a user flow diagram had been constructed to show the possible paths the user can take through the intended website design proposal; particularly through different pages, links and navigations. User flow diagrams can also be referred to as 'user journey mapping' of which it is a way of presenting and describing every important step of a complex experience in a single overview (Tomitsch, 2019). The user journey map facilitates this process by visually representing all steps of an experience (Tomitsch, 2019). Hence, two seperate user flow diagrams had been created for both the dekstop and smartphone platform in order to show the various paths the user can go through. It also emphases what pages serve as the 'main process' in facilitating blood as well as the 'side information' that users can browse through as well. Hence, the user flow diagrams include:</p>
