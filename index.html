			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this web documentation report is to effectively provide users a justification and rationale behind the various design descisions taken in the prototype website for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Correspondingly, the various iterations and changes of the website prototype will be documented; aided by the explanation of fundamental design descisions that had led the designers towards making those particular changes.</p>
			<h3 id="reflection">Reflection on Website Design Proposal</h3>
			<p>The intended website prototype will effectively use the final mockups (ideated within the website design proposal) as a reference for which it is created upon. Correspondingly, feedback gained previously from the website design proposal itself (through tutors and users) will be also applied as an iteration through the intended website prototype. However, it is notable that the process of feedback and improvement is an ongoing iterative process in which the designers intend to constantly collect and recieve user feedback in order to be analysed and applied to the final intended web prototype for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood.</p>
      <h4>Feedback Recieved on Web Design Proposal</h4>
      <blockquote>"Ideation and Concept Exploration Highly detailed ideation and concept development process. Multiple layout explored for each page, and design decisions are outlined in annotations with evidence of self-reflection and evaluation. This part of your proposal is amazing. Consider drawing from your background research and user profiles as well to justify your choices and decisions. Wireframes build upon the sketches, with show evidence of further refinement. Mobile layout is also well considered. C3: Application of Design Principles and Patterns Fantastic transition from web to mobile, very well considered. Your mockups needed to be higher fidelity so we can see additional design choices. Overall, good job with areas to improve."<strong> - Brittany Klassens, Tutor</strong></blockquote>
      <h4>Feedback Recieved on Mockups</h4>
      <p> After analysing feedback from tutors regarding the previous website design proposal, the designer had asked various users to give their feedback on the mockups and potentially suggest any improvements that would ultimately improve the overall user experience and user interface of the intended website prototype. Through this, three participants had volunteered to provide informal feedback of which was to later to be used to improve the various iterations of the website prototype for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Hence, they include:</p>
      <blockquote>"I love the colour and aesthetic of the mockups, particularly the landing page, it is really nice!. However if I had to suggest an improvement, I want the navigation bar to have less options, it's too overclustered right now"<strong> Jessica Tran, 22</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"If there was only a way for you to compress the pages. I feel like there are too many pages when multiple web pages could just be on a singular one"<strong> Nathan Lowe, 18</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"If you can get the whole 'streamlined' process of donating blood with the progress bar at the bottom, that would be absolutely amazing"<strong> Susana Tolentino, 34</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>The following web documentation report will be structured according to the following list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Landing Page</li>
        <li>Blood donation and eligibility details page</li>
        <li>Eligible call-to-action page</li>
        <li>Ineligible call-to-action page</li>
        <li>Centres near me page</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Therefore, it is through this scaffold that each prototyped web page will have its unique section in this web documentation report. Correspondingly, it is through each section (that each web page prototype represents) that the designers iteration, rationale and justifcation descisions will be explored; particularly through annotations, screenshots and comparisons between the mockups, prototypes and numerous iterations.</p>
