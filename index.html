			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this web documentation report is to effectively provide users a justification and rationale behind the various design descisions taken in the prototype website for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Correspondingly, the various iterations and changes of the website prototype will be documented; aided by the explanation of fundamental design descisions that had led the designers towards making those particular changes.</p>
			<h3 id="reflection">Reflection on Website Design Proposal</h3>
			<p>The intended website prototype will effectively use the final mockups (ideated within the website design proposal) as a reference for which it is created upon. Correspondingly, feedback gained previously from the website design proposal itself (through tutors and users) will be also applied as an iteration through the intended website prototype. However, it is notable that the process of feedback and improvement is an ongoing iterative process in which the designers intend to constantly collect and recieve user feedback in order to be analysed and applied to the final intended web prototype for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood.</p>
      <h4>Feedback Recieved on Web Design Proposal</h4>
      <blockquote>"Ideation and Concept Exploration Highly detailed ideation and concept development process. Multiple layout explored for each page, and design decisions are outlined in annotations with evidence of self-reflection and evaluation. This part of your proposal is amazing. Consider drawing from your background research and user profiles as well to justify your choices and decisions. Wireframes build upon the sketches, with show evidence of further refinement. Mobile layout is also well considered. C3: Application of Design Principles and Patterns Fantastic transition from web to mobile, very well considered. Your mockups needed to be higher fidelity so we can see additional design choices. Overall, good job with areas to improve."<strong> - Brittany Klassens, Tutor</strong></blockquote>
      <h4>Feedback Recieved on Mockups</h4>
      <p> After analysing feedback from tutors regarding the previous website design proposal, the designer had asked various users to give their feedback on the mockups and potentially suggest any improvements that would ultimately improve the overall user experience and user interface of the intended website prototype. Through this, three participants had volunteered to provide informal feedback of which was to later to be used to improve the various iterations of the website prototype for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Hence, they include:</p>
      <blockquote>"I love the colour and aesthetic of the mockups, particularly the landing page, it is really nice!. However if I had to suggest an improvement, I want the navigation bar to have less options, it's too overclustered right now"<strong> Jessica Tran, 22</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"If there was only a way for you to compress the pages. I feel like there are too many pages when multiple web pages could just be on a singular one"<strong> Nathan Lowe, 18</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>"If you can get the whole 'streamlined' process of donating blood with the progress bar at the bottom, that would be absolutely amazing"<strong> Susana Tolentino, 34</strong></blockquote>

		<section id="documentation">
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>The following web documentation report will be structured according to the following list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Landing Page</li>
        <li>Blood Donation Details Page </li>
        <li>Eligibility details page</li>
        <li>Eligible call-to-action page</li>
        <li>Ineligible call-to-action page</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Therefore, it is through this scaffold that each prototyped web page will have its unique section in this web documentation report. Correspondingly, it is through each section (that each web page prototype represents) that the designers iteration, rationale and justifcation descisions will be explored; particularly through annotations screenshots and comparisons between the mockups, prototypes and numerous iterations.</p>
      
      <h3 id="landingpage">Landing Page</h3>
			<p>The landing page of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood proposal website had been intended to give users an effective and clear first impression of what the proposal website had to offer to the user in whole. Hence, the designers intentions behind creating the landing page was to be as <strong>simple as possible</strong> through limiting the amount of elements of the page. Correspondingly, the <strong> colors and font </strong> across the landing page had been consistent as inspired by the web proposal documentation mood board.</p>
      <h3>Annotated Elements on the Page</h3>
      <p>There are a range of elements on the page that had taken various design justifcations and descisions in order for them to be published on the final iteration of the landing page. Hence they include:</p>
      <h4>The ACRL Landing Page (1)</h4>
       <figure>

        </figure>
      <h4>The ACRL Landing Page (2)</h4>
      <figure>
				<img src="documentation/landingpage-03.jpg" alt="Landing Page Prototype Annotation"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Iterations Between the Mockups and the Final Prototype</h4>
      <p>The overall visual style and aesthetic of the landing page across both the mockup and final prototype had stayed consistent with very minimal change. The largest difference between the mockup and final prototype had included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Condensation of pages:</strong> External pages such as the contact us page and the social media page had been removed and thus included within the landing page instead. This design descision had been justified to give the user the easiest possible usability within the website by keeping the amount of HTML pages to a minimum.</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent navigation bar:</strong> What had previously been a hamburger button in the mobile version of the ACRL website has now been removed. Instead, the navigation bar across both desktop and mobile are now the same as it is visually appealing and works extremely well on all devices.</li>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>User Feedback</h4>
      <p>It is also notable that numerous informal usability tests among users had contributed towards the various iterations between the mockups and final prototpyes through their extremely valuable feedback. Users were shown the mockups and various iterations of the webiste prototype and had given their feedback through the think-aloud protocol. Hence, it was through this feedback given that had justified and validated the final website proposal iteration that is currently avaliable for the user to view. Hence, some think-aloud protocol quotes included:</p>
      <blockquote> This landing page is awesome, and its visual aesthetic is really nice and fits in well within the context of the whole website. I also love the consistency of the navigation bar across all my devices! - <strong> Brooklyn Tanovic, 20</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>I don't think you need a whole seperate page for just the contact details, this could definitely just be implemented within the landing page, or some other page, it just seems like a waste of a page - <strong> Amy McLean, 18</strong></blockquote>
			
      <h3 id="details">Blood Details Page</h3>
			<p>The Blood Details page of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood proposal website had been intended to give users a detailed overview of the blood donation process and the vast impact they can have through their generous donations. This intent had been mainly brought into effect through both visual and textual statistics, relevant and detailed information as well as consistent and easy lists to read (both ordered and unordered). </p>
      <h3>Annotated Elements on the Page</h3>
      <p>There are a range of elements on the page that had taken various design justifcations and descisions in order for them to be published on the final iteration of the landing page. Hence they include:</p>
      <h4>Blood Details Page (1)</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Iterations Between the Mockups and the Final Prototype</h4>
      <p>The overall visual style and aesthetic of the blood details page in the prototype had stayed mainly similar, hence having very minimal change compared to the mockup. However, there were some noticable differences of which had included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The removal of the progress bar:</strong> The progress bar had been mainly removed as it had served no real purpose for the final website prototype. According to user feedback, it was notable that the blood donation and eligibility process had been so short, that were was absolutely no need for a progress bar; particularly for such a short process.</li>
          <li><strong>Addition of more content:</strong> While the content of the mockup had been transferred to the website prototype, the designers felt that it was necessary to add more content such as statistics and vital blood donation details that would serve beneficial to the whole blood donation process. Correspondingly, designers felt that information such as "experiences of blood donators" and "how your donation works" were all content that users needed to know and acknowledge before embarking upon a blood donation process</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>User Feedback</h4>
      <p>It is also notable that numerous informal usability tests among users had contributed towards the various iterations between the mockups and final prototpyes through their extremely valuable feedback. Users were shown the mockups and various iterations of the webiste prototype and had given their feedback through the think-aloud protocol. Hence, it was through this feedback given that had justified and validated the final website proposal iteration that is currently avaliable for the user to view. Hence, some think-aloud protocol quotes included:</p>
      <blockquote> The grid and visual style of this website just works, however I don't see any need for a progress bar within this website... The process is already so short, the percentages and progress at the bottom just do not make sense and are extremely irrelevant. Other than that, I love the look, feel and content of this page - <strong>Brooklyn Tanovic, 20</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote> There seems to be a lot of content on this page which is really good, however I feel like you need to make the margins larger so that it is easier for users to read and comprehend this really important information<strong> - Mary Jalon, 34</strong></blockquote>

      <h3 id="criteria">Eligibility Criteria Page</h3>
			<p>The eligibility criteria page of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood prototype website had been intended to inform the user of the physical and health requirements a user must meet in order to effectively donate blood. Hence, through the use of various design principles, the designers aim of the website was to make the eligibility information and criteria to be as easily comprehended as possible. Correspondingly, the designers wanted no error when users had to determine whether they were eligible or ineligible to donate blood. Hence these intentions had been achieved through using easy unordered lists of criteria that users can follow and apply themselves to. Correspondingly, a eligiblity form could be filled out for users who were unusre and confused about their eligiblity status or just wanted to confirm their eligibility status as well.</p>
      <h3>Annotated Elements on the Page</h3>
      <p>There are a range of elements on the page that had taken various design justifcations and descisions in order for them to be published on the final iteration of the landing page. Hence they include:</p>

      <h4>Iterations Between the Mockups and the Final Prototype</h4>
      <p>The overall visual style and aesthetic of the blood details page in the prototype had stayed mainly similar, hence having very minimal change compared to the mockup. However, there were some noticable differences of which had included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addition of unordered bullet points</strong>: Rather than just a harsh paragraph block of information shown within the mockup, the designers had felt it was nescessary to convert that information into bullet points of which can be easily comprehended by the user. Through this, there would be minimal error in differentiating eligible and ineligible users through the overall blood donation process as users could apply their circumstances to those dot points.</li>
        <li><strong>The removal of the progress bar</strong>: This point had already been explored in further detail in the previous section.</li>
      </ul>

Users were shown the mockups and various iterations of the webiste prototype and had given their feedback through the think-aloud protocol. Hence, it was through this feedback given that had justified and validated the final website proposal iteration that is currently avaliable for the user to view. Hence, some think-aloud protocol quotes included:</p>
      <blockquote>Honestly I don't think I would have the effort or concentration to go ahead and read through every bullet point, so I am really glad that this page has a short and easy form to fill out of which can determione my eligiblity criteria - <strong>Katherine Sosa, 24</strong></blockquote>
      <blockquote>I really appreciate how the dot points really get to the point. It makes it easier for me to go ahead and find out whether I am eligible to donate blood or not, and then I can easily go to either the eligible or inelgible page to go ahead and finish off the whole process - <strong>Amy Mclean, 18</strong></blockquote>
      
      <h3 id="eligible">Eligible CTA Page</h3>
			<p>The eligible call-to-action page of the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood website prototype is the final step of the blood donation process for users who are deemed physically able and eligible to donate blood. Through this, the intent of the page was to allow users to enter their details for an ACRL representative to contact them and thus carry out the final physical step of the blood donation process to actually donate blood. Hence, this had been facillitated through a simple form where users can enter their details and submit.</p>
